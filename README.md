> Note: most of the code in `src/lib/classes/Highlighter.ts` is adapted from Mathieu Jouhet's awesome paper [*Highlighting html text (07/03/2023)*](https://observablehq.com/@daformat/highlighting-html-text), some changes were made to add options such as *Match Whole Word*, and rewrite the highlighting element creation and removal for improved performance.
